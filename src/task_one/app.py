    Solve Task One for the Coday coding competition.

    This function reads input from a file, processes it according to the task
    requirements, and returns the computed result.

    Args:

    Returns:
        The computed result as an integer, string, or float depending on
        the problem requirements.

    Example:
        >>> result = solve("Resources/Test0.txt")
